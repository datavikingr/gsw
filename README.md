# gsw - git status watch

gsw is a git status watcher, with some push and pull features. It's a tui-based HUD for your repos while you code.

Think of it as top for git repo management; or even lazygit, but even lazier.

## Features:
- status, logs, working directory, branch
- git add .
- git commit
- git push/pull 
- custom polling time (default 10s) and custom path (default current directory) as arguments
- install script (user or global install)
