# gsw - git status watch

gsw is a git status watcher, with some push and pull features. It's a tui-based HUD for your repos while you code.

Think of it as similar to top/htop for git repo management; or even lazygit- but even lazier.

## Features:
- install.sh now updates and installs per user or globally!
- status, logs, working directory, branch in HUD
- git add . , commit, push/pull, ignore, rm
- custom polling time (default 10s) and custom path (default current directory) as arguments

## TODO:
- add git branch mechanics
- add update check to gsw.sh

## Install (or Update)
Navigate to your code directory, pull/clone as desired.

Then run:
```
./install.sh
```

That's it! Thanks for chosing gsw!!
